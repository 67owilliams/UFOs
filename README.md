Dana is given the oppurtunity to write about her hometown in Oregon and also put together a report on one of her favorite topics, UFO's. The purpose of this ananlysis to to create an HTML page of information on various UFO sightings. The page also has the capability to filter the information based on date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
The search function on the webpage is easdy to use. You can narrow down the data with filtering by the date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO sightings around the world. You can search by using a single criteria. Either by a specific date (ex: 1/10/2010).

 ## Summary:
 One drawback that this webpage is that in order to use the input in order to filter you must type exactly as the data is shown in the table (ie: Texas must be abbreviated, and Jan 1, 2010 must written as 1/10/2010). A few ways the website can be improved is fixing the strictness of the filter input, being able to return a searched based on non abbreviated and non abbreviated searches. Also be able to sort the data by alphabetical or numerical order.
